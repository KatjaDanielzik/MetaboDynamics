MetaboDynamics provides a framework of Bayesian models for robust and
easy analysis of longitudinal Metabolomics Data. It takes concentration
tables as input and provides robust estimation of mean concentrations,
functional enrichment analysis employing the KEGG database and
comparison of dynamic clusters of different biological conditions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MetaboDynamics from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
